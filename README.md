## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/wyomarus/wayfinder/releases) page.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` directory.
3. Ensure the folder is named `Wayfinder`.

## Usage

Once installed, Wayfinder will automatically display a compass banner at the top of your screen when you log into the game. The banner shows cardinal and intercardinal directions plus a marker, distance, and ETA readout for whatever you're currently super-tracking (a quest, a waypoint, a corpse run, etc.). It hides itself automatically while you're inside an instance.

The banner is locked in place by default; `/wayfinder unlock` it to drag it to a new spot, then `/wayfinder lock` it back down - see [Commands](#commands).

SuperTracking currently follows quests, user-placed waypoints, area POIs, taxi nodes, and your own corpse. Other trackable target types (scenarios, world content, party members, vignettes) aren't handled yet, so the marker just won't appear for those.

All of the above is configurable from a "Wayfinder" panel in the game's own Settings (Escape > Options > AddOns), reachable with `/wayfinder settings` or from the minimap's Addon Compartment dropdown, which also toggles the banner with a click.
